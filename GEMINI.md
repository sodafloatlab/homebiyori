# Gemini CLI Agent Guidelines

## Code Development Standards

To ensure maintainability and clarity, especially for new contributors, the following guidelines must be adhered to when developing or modifying backend code:

1.  **Comprehensive Code Comments:** When creating or modifying backend files, ensure that comments are meticulously added to explain the logic, especially for complex sections. Comments should be clear enough for a beginner to understand the purpose and functionality of the code.

2.  **Intent Explanation for Code Changes:** For any code modification or creation, provide a clear explanation of the intent behind the changes. This includes *why* a particular approach was chosen and *what* problem it solves.

3.  **Test Code Documentation:** When creating test code, include a comprehensive list of test items at the beginning of the test file. Each test case within the code should be clearly linked to its corresponding item in this list through comments. This ensures that test coverage can be easily tracked and understood across the entire project.
